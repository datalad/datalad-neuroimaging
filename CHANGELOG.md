## 0.3.4 (Oct 24, 2023) -- Make BIDS great again

- BIDS metadata extractor(s): do not require `participants.tsv` file to be present
  (it is RECOMMENDED not REQUIRED in BIDS)
- `cfg_bids` procedure: do not annex any `README*`, `LICENSE`, or
  `.bids-validator-config.json` files
- documentation: fix builds on RTD

## 0.3.3 (Oct 28, 2022) -- Oktoberfest

- raise dependency on datalad-deprecated which was prematurely released

## 0.3.2 (Oct 25, 2022) -- ... but grandparents always are

- increase dependency on datalad to 0.16.7
- depend on datalad-metalad and datalad-deprecated for both styles of metadata
  extractors
- update the metadata extractors to work with current numpy versions
- BIDS extractor compatible with pybids>=0.15.1 and BIDS v1.6.0
- fix nifti1 metadata extractor not dealing properly with byte strings
- various internal changes and fixes around testing and CI setup

## 0.3.1 (Jun 3, 2020) -- Uncles aren't always nice either

- be compatible with pydicom 2.0.0

## 0.3.0 (Feb 26, 2020) -- ... and parents become grumpier

- DataLad 0.12 series is now minimal supported

## 0.2.4 (Feb 05, 2020) -- Kids are growing

Minor bugfix release to account for changes in pybids and datalad

- pybids:
  - demand pybids >=0.9.2
  - account for new field  "extension" provided by BIDS now
  - use get_dataset_description if available
- pandas:
  - use .iloc instead of deprecated .ix
- datalad
  - use -d^ instead of deprecated (in 0.12) -S in an example script

## 0.2.3 (May 24, 2019) -- Old is not bad

Minor quick bugfix release to demand pybids < 0.9 since we are not yet fully
ready for its full glory

## 0.2.2 (May 20, 2019) -- It was like that way before!

Minor bugfix release
- revert back to old ways of installing package data so test data and procedures
  get properly installed

## 0.2.1 (May 17, 2019) -- Why wasn't it that way before?

- include a procedure 'cfg_bids' to configure BIDS datasets
- fix several issues with troublesome dependency declarations

## 0.2.0 (Feb 09, 2019) -- Am I compatible with you honey?

- Make compatible with (and demand) pybids 0.7.{0,1}.  0.7.0 introduced
  change of terms: modality -> suffix, and type -> datatype, which would now
  require to either reaggregate all previous metadata or somehow fixup
  in-place existing metadata files. And for 0.7.1 workaround was added to
  not return `suffix` at least when participants.tsv was queried.
- Make compatible with pydicom 1.0 in treatment of MultiValue
- Refactorings:
  - tests: 
    - use `export_archive` instead of plain `tarfile.open`
    - make compatible with recent (0.11.x) DataLad which now extract annex
      keys etc

## 0.1.5 (Sep 28, 2018) -- BIDS robustness

- Assorted improvements of the BIDS metadata extractor performance on datasets
  in the wild.

## 0.1.4 (Aug 02, 2018) -- PyBIDS

- Fixed compatibility with pybids 0.6.4 and now demand it as the minimal
  PyBIDS version

## 0.1 (Apr 28, 2018) -- The Release

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- This is the first separate release of DataLad's neuroimaging functionality as an
  extension module.
- Metadata
  - BIDS metadata now uniformly refers to subjects and participants using the
    metadata key 'subject' 

### Enhancements and new features

- Extractors now report progress (with DataLad 0.10+)
- BIDS participant metadata is now read via pybids

### Fixes

- Fix issue with unicode characters in BIDS metadata
- DICOM metadata now also contains the 'PatientName' field that was previously
  excluded due to a too restrictive data type filter
